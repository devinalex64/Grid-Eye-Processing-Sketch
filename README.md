# Grid-Eye-Processing-Sketch
This is originally a sketch that was developed by the github user [arms22](https://github.com/arms22)

This code was found on a [blog post created by arms22](http://arms22.blog91.fc2.com/blog-entry-600.html) that was linked in a response by Yusuke Sasaki to a comment asking a question on a [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZ35eeKrF2Y) that Yusuke Sasaki posted. The question that was asked was to provide the source code that was running on processing used in the video.
